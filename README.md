# Raspberry Pi Basics (Learning Log)

This repository documents my step-by-step progress learning Raspberry Pi fundamentals:
Linux basics, terminal usage, Python scripting on Pi, SSH remote access, and Python environments.

**Goal:** Build a strong foundation before moving into hardware + robotics projects.

## How I’m Using This Repo
Each week includes:
- `notes.md` → what I learned (in my own words)
- `exercises/` or `scripts/` → small practice files
- a weekly progress log in `/progress`

## Next Project
After finishing the basics, I will start a new repository:
**Desktop Companion Robot** (movement + voice + interaction + data logging + analysis).
